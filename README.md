# binary-sort
A dumb test I had to do for some Hiring Tournament ...

## What is this?
I've once participated in a "Hiring Tournament" for a very well known Company which invites IT Professionals to Cross over the Remote working in some sort of pretentious way of recruiting people ...
The thing is that during this event, we all attendants had to do a series of tests. One of them was this one, where:

 - The user had to be able to enter a list of values
 - Those values had to be sorted based on their binary value (That is the amount of ones and zeros)
 - The values having more "ones" were "bigger"
 - If the same amount of "ones" happened; the decimal value will be considered.
 
 And so; I came up with this Procedural code.
 Is not here to like you, and/or to be criticized. If it likes you or it is usefull for you, well; I am glad. And if it's not I will be glad anyway :P

Greetings
